            If you’ve ever dreamed of publishing your own book, chances are
            you’ve come across Amazon KDP, short for Kindle Direct Publishing.
            And rightly so. Amazon KDP is one of the fastest, easiest, and most
            accessible platforms for turning your manuscript into a published
            eBook or paperback and reaching millions of readers around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what exactly is Amazon KDP? How does it work? And how can you
            make sure your book doesn’t just get published, but gets discovered
            and sells?
          </p>
          <p>
            Grab a pen (or open your notes app), because we’re about to break
            down Amazon KDP from A to Z, and show you how Broadway Publishers
            can make your publishing journey easier, smoother, and more
            profitable.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Amazon KDP?</h2>
          <p>
            Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing is a self-publishing platform. It
            allows authors to publish eBooks and paperbacks directly to Amazon
            without needing a traditional publishing deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s completely free to use, offers global distribution, and gives
            you up to 70% royalties on eBook sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re a fiction writer, non-fiction expert, children’s
            author, or entrepreneur with a brilliant idea, KDP gives you the
            tools to launch your book in the biggest online bookstore on the
            planet.
          </p>
          <h2>How Does Amazon KDP Work?</h2>
          <p>Book Publishing on Amazon KDP involves a few basic steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating a KDP Account:</strong> Sign in using your Amazon
              account or create a new KDP account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Preparing Your Manuscript:</strong> Format your book
              according to Amazon's specifications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Designing a Cover:</strong> Either upload your own cover
              or use Amazon’s Cover Creator tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Uploading Your Files:</strong> Submit your manuscript and
              cover (PDF for print, or .doc/.epub for eBooks).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Setting Pricing & Royalties:</strong> Choose your price
              point and royalty structure (35% or 70%).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hitting Publish!</strong> Your book will typically be live
              on Amazon within 72 hours.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Technically, it is. But successfully publishing on KDP is another
            story entirely.

          <h2>The Problem Most Authors Face</h2>
          <p>
            Most first-time authors think, “If I publish it, people will buy
            it.”
          </p>
          <p>Spoiler alert: They won’t.</p>
          <p>
            With millions of titles on Amazon, your book can easily vanish into
            obscurity if it’s not properly optimized. Without the right
            keywords, categories, cover design, description, and marketing plan,
            your dream book might gather dust, even on a digital shelf.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why most self-published books never sell more than a handful
            of copies.
          </p>

          <h2>Amazon KDP Royalties Explained</h2>
          <p>Amazon gives authors two royalty options for eBooks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>35% Royalty:</strong> Available for books priced between
              $0.99 and $200. Simple, but with limitations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>70% Royalty:</strong> Available for books priced between
              $2.99 and $9.99, with a few additional conditions (like delivery
              fees based on file size).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Print books work on a different royalty model: You earn 60% of list
            price minus printing costs.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2>Tips for Succeeding on Amazon KDP</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Want your book to rise to the top? Here's what separates
              bestsellers from “also-rans”:
            </li>
            <li>Don’t try to appeal to everyone. Serve your ideal reader.</li>
            <li>
              Amazon is a search engine. You need SEO, use the right keywords.
            </li>
            <li>Social proof drives conversions, get more reviews. </li>
            <li>
              Your launch strategy should include email lists, social media,
              podcasts, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              The more books you have, the more credibility you gain, and the
              easier it is to sell.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Should You Self-Publish with Amazon KDP?</h2>
          <p>Yes, but not alone.</p>
          <p>
            While Amazon KDP gives you incredible access to readers and high
            royalties, going the self-publishing route without expert help can
            quickly turn into a frustrating maze of technical steps, marketing
            missteps, and lost potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Publishing a book isn't just about uploading a file, it's about
            launching a product. And if you want your book to sell, earn great
            reviews, and actually reach people, you need more than a dream. You
            need a strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            So instead of trying to figure it all out yourself, hire an{"  "}
